The definition of assistance tools, by using the image, seems to be applicable whatever the stage of the process of architectural design is. This article presents three approaches, which intend to study the contribution of the image inside of the architectural design process. The first approach rests on the idea that architects use external references as generating elements of new project ideas and that it is possible to organize this referential knowledge by taking the image as structuring entity of this knowledge. The two other approaches intend to use image to support the formulation of information designer's needs in more advanced phases of the design process. The identified needs are those of the architect who searches a particular information in order to justify or to perform some choices, during the act of conception.},

	abstract = {The rise of visual culture and the role of images in shaping contemporary thought and global society has been a constant since the end of the last century. Called “Iconic turn” in the field of philosophy of perception and image theory, this process has captured increasing attention in diverse academic fields, even in disciplines such as architecture where the role of images has not always been well considered. There is no doubt, however, that the visual nature of architecture makes the image essential in its conception, representation or perception. Within this relationship between architecture and image can be noted a recent change: a progressive attention toward realism as an alternative to an arbitrariness of form whose main consequence has been an uncritical use of images by architects and their consumption by society. The visual nature of some of the most influential works of the British architects Sergison Bates and Tony Fretton are exemplary for this purpose, aware of the importance of images in the shaping of everyday life and in the architectural narratives of the real. These works, in turn, allow us to explore the reciprocal strengthening that this realism as an attitude in being (architecture) and in looking (photography) has for an architectural practice that feeds on images and engenders them.},

	abstract = {Effective planning in model-based reinforcement learning ({MBRL}) and model-predictive control ({MPC}) relies on the accuracy of the learned dynamics model. In many instances of {MBRL} and {MPC}, this model is assumed to be stationary and is periodically re-trained from scratch on state transition experience collected from the beginning of environment interactions. This implies that the time required to train the dynamics model - and the pause required between plan executions - grows linearly with the size of the collected experience. We argue that this is too slow for lifelong robot learning and propose {HyperCRL}, a method that continually learns the encountered dynamics in a sequence of tasks using task-conditional hypernetworks. Our method has three main attributes: first, it includes dynamics learning sessions that do not revisit training data from previous tasks, so it only needs to store the most recent fixed-size portion of the state transition experience; second, it uses fixed-capacity hypernetworks to represent non-stationary and task-aware dynamics; third, it outperforms existing continual learning alternatives that rely on fixed-capacity networks, and does competitively with baselines that remember an ever increasing coreset of past experience. We show that {HyperCRL} is effective in continual model-based reinforcement learning in robot locomotion and manipulation scenarios, such as tasks involving pushing and door opening.

Therefore, it is essential to comprehend the principles and advancements of generative {AI} models and analyze their relevance in architecture applications. This paper first provides an overview of generative {AI} technologies, with a focus on probabilistic diffusion models ({DDPMs}), 3D generative models, and foundation models, highlighting their recent developments and main application scenarios. Then, the paper explains how the abovementioned models could be utilized in architecture. We subdivide the architectural design process into six steps and review related research projects in each step from 2020 to the present. Lastly, this paper discusses potential future directions for applying generative {AI} in the architectural design steps.

This confirms known benefits such as speeding-up and freeing-up of ideation and highlights the need for designers to evaluate sketched ideas by means of images simulating their real-life rendering, as well as the need for inspiration to materialize the premises of ideas that are still vague.},

However, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different contexts. In this work, we present a new approach for "personalization" of text-to-image diffusion models. Given as input just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can be used to synthesize novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views and lighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, and artistic rendering, all while preserving the subject's key features. We also provide a new dataset and evaluation protocol for this new task of subject-driven generation. Project page: https://dreambooth.github.io/},

	abstract = {Text-to-image models offer unprecedented freedom to guide creation through natural language. Yet, it is unclear how such freedom can be exercised to generate images of specific unique concepts, modify their appearance, or compose them in new roles and novel scenes. In other words, we ask: how can we use language-guided models to turn our cat into a painting, or imagine a new product based on our favorite toy? Here we present a simple approach that allows such creative freedom. Using only 3-5 images of a user-provided concept, like an object or a style, we learn to represent it through new "words" in the embedding space of a frozen text-to-image model. These "words" can be composed into natural language sentences, guiding personalized creation in an intuitive way. Notably, we find evidence that a single word embedding is sufficient for capturing unique and varied concepts. We compare our approach to a wide range of baselines, and demonstrate that it can more faithfully portray the concepts across a range of applications and tasks.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2106.09685},
	shorttitle = {{LoRA}},
	abstract = {An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using {GPT}-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or {LoRA}, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to {GPT}-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, {LoRA} can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the {GPU} memory requirement by 3 times. {LoRA} performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on {RoBERTa}, {DeBERTa}, {GPT}-2, and {GPT}-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of {LoRA}. We release a package that facilitates the integration of {LoRA} with {PyTorch} models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for {RoBERTa}, {DeBERTa}, and {GPT}-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/{LoRA}.},

	volume = {11},
	abstract = {Computer-aided design ({CAD}) tools have been extensively used by the architects for the several decades. It has evolved from being a simple drafting tool to being an intelligent architectural software and a powerful means of communication for architects. {CAD} plays an essential role in the profession of architecture and is a basic tool for any architectural firm. It is not possible for an architectural firm to compete without taking the advantage of computer software, due to the high demand and competition in the architectural industry. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impacts of {CAD} on the architectural design process from conceptual level to final product, particularly in architectural practice. It examines the range of benefits of integrating {CAD} into the industry and discusses the possible defects limiting the architects. Method of this study is qualitatively based on data collected from the professionals’ perspective. The identified benefits and limitations of {CAD} on the architectural design process will raise the awareness of professionals on the potentials of {CAD} and proper utilization of that in the industry, which would result in a higher productivity along with a better quality in the architectural offices.},

Results of early tests can provide estimates of the number of problems left to be found and the number of additional evaluations needed to find a given fraction. With quantitative evaluation costs and detection values, the model can estimate the numbers of evaluations at which optimal cost/benefit ratios are obtained and at which marginal utility vanishes. For a “medium” example, we estimate that 16 evaluations would be worth their cost, with maximum benefit/cost ratio at four.},

@online{berlage_architects_2022,
	title = {The Architect’s Mannerism},
	url = {https://theberlage.nl/events/the-architect-s-mannerism},
	abstract = {As the Dutch art historian Hessel Miedema has written, sixteenth century Mannerism meant above all a “method of working”: The often maligned movement owed “its special nature to the fact that artists worked so much ‘di maniera’ i.e. the working method based on routine, which had a marked influence on the external characteristics of the works of art.” As work became increasingly routinized, the resulting paintings, sculptures, and architecture became increasingly stylized. Our talk addresses the routine practices of selecting, copying, and arranging that once constituted the foundations of Mannerism. But we turn away from historical conventions toward the tools and behaviors of the contemporary architectural workplace. 

One key site for the reproduction and acceleration of workplace routines and their resulting architectural styles is the operation of “mood boarding.” Mood boards increasingly organize the social life of design firms, guiding projects toward completion.  Though mood boards emerge from a diverse set of epistemologies and traditions, they are now used within the creative industries, including architecture, to pitch ideas to coworkers and elicit interest from clients.  Drawing upon recent ethnographies of professional communities, as well as our own fieldwork inside architecture firms, we will consider how mood boards reveal key routines and conventions within contemporary architectural practice and beyond.

The Berlage Sessions, a seven-part seminar series entitled “The Architect’s Manners,” explores the profession through etiquette and manners, the contractual distinction between builder and architect, the graphic conventions of working drawings, architects and their relationship to social media, the stylization of imagery, the masculinity embodied in practice, and other ways “mannerism” is enacted by architects today. This fall, speakers will include Mary Woods, Bryan Norwood, Annette Spiro, Floris van der Poel, Stefano Milani, Namelok, and Jacob and Samuel Stewart-Halevy. 

Samuel Stewart-Halevy is an architect and current doctoral candidate in the History and Theory of Architecture at Columbia University. Previously he taught as a Visiting Artist in the Architecture, Interior Architecture, and Designed Objects Department at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and as the 2013–15 Wortham Teaching Fellow at the Rice University School of Architecture.  His current research follows the artifacts of participatory design, including mood boards, in the postwar period as they make their way through historically and geographically interlinked settings.  

Jacob Stewart-Halevy works on the nexus of modern and contemporary art, intellectual history, and social theory. Subspecialties include histories of conceptual art, design, and video; sociology and anthropology of art; political economy of art; and historiography. He is the author of Slant Steps ({UC} Press, 2020) and ‘Sypher’s Cipher: “Paradoxes of Conduct” in the Reception of Mannerism, 1954-1973’ (Journal of Art Historiography, 2019). He currently serves as assistant professor of History of Art and Architecture at Tufts University and has been a visiting research fellow in Anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin since 2019.

The application of artificial intelligence to this process should not be oriented toward finding a solution in a defined search space since the design requirements are not yet well defined in the conceptual stage. Instead, this process should be considered as an exploration of the requirements, as well as of possible solutions to meet those requirements. This work offers a tour of major research projects that apply artificial intelligence solutions to architectural conceptual design. We examine several approaches, but most of the work focuses on the use of evolutionary computing to perform these tasks. We note a marked increase in the number of papers in recent years, especially since 2015. Most employ evolutionary computing techniques, including cellular automata. Most initial approaches were oriented toward finding innovative and creative forms, while the latest research focuses on optimizing architectural form.},

The neural architecture is connected with "zero convolutions" (zero-initialized convolution layers) that progressively grow the parameters from zero and ensure that no harmful noise could affect the finetuning. We test various conditioning controls, e.g., edges, depth, segmentation, human pose, etc., with Stable Diffusion, using single or multiple conditions, with or without prompts. We show that the training of {ControlNets} is robust with small ({\textless}50k) and large ({\textgreater}1m) datasets. Extensive results show that {ControlNet} may facilitate wider applications to control image diffusion models.},

	abstract = {This research examines the projects of star architects who develop architectural designs using artificial intelligence and the impact of this technology on changing the role of the star architect. In this context, nine prominent architectural groups—Zaha Hadid Architects, Coop Himmelblau, Morphosis, Foster \& Partners, Skidmore, Owings \& Merrill, Vincent Callebaut, Arup, {MAD} Architecture, and {UN} Studio—are analyzed to demonstrate how these architects integrate artificial intelligence into the creative process and how the traditional role of the architect has changed. The originality of the research lies in its focus on the relationship between artificial intelligence and the star architects standing at the intersection of architecture and technology. Star architects shape architecture with their productions and discourses. The study is based on qualitative analysis, and the documents and publications of the projects of star architects were evaluated by the content analysis method. Our findings indicate that artificial intelligence has expanded the architect's role in creative processes. With artificial intelligence, each star architect is rediscovering the boundaries of architecture and creating innovative and creative designs. Consequently, the study examines how artificial intelligence influences architectural practice by analyzing the works of renowned star architects.},

Due to the development of artificial intelligence diffusion models, the utilization of text descriptions for the generation of creative designs has become a novel method for solving the aforementioned problem. Herein, we build a unique interior decoration style dataset. Thus, we solve the problem pertaining to the need for datasets, propose a new loss function that considers the decoration style, and retrain the diffusion model using this dataset. The trained model learns interior design knowledge and can generate an interior design through text. The proposed method replaces the designer’s drawing with computer-generated creative design, thereby enhancing the design efficiency and creative generation. Specifically, the proposed diffusion model can generate interior design images of specific decoration styles and spatial functions end to end from text descriptions, and the generated designs are easy to modify. This novel and creative design method can efficiently generate various interior designs, promote the generation of creative designs, and enhance the design and decision-making efficiency.},

	abstract = {By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models ({DMs}) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful {DMs} often consumes hundreds of {GPU} days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable {DM} training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models ({LDMs}) achieve new state of the art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based {DMs}.},

Our study is the ﬁrst to investigate the potential of text-to-image generators in supporting creativity during the early stages of the architectural design process. We conducted a laboratory study with 17 architecture students, who developed a concept for a culture center using three popular text-to-image generators: Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and {DALL}-E. Through standardized questionnaires and group interviews, we found that image generation could be a meaningful part of the design process when design constraints are carefully considered. Generative tools support serendipitous discovery of ideas and an imaginative mindset, enriching the design process. We identiﬁed several challenges of image generators and provided considerations for software development and educators to support creativity and emphasize designers’ imaginative mindset. By understanding the limitations and potential of text-to-image generators, architects and designers can leverage this technology in their design process and education, facilitating innovation and effective communication of concepts.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in low-rank adaptation ({LoRA}) have shown its effectiveness in fine-tuning diffusion models for generating images tailored to new downstream tasks. Research on integrating multiple {LoRA} modules to accommodate new tasks has also gained traction. One emerging approach constructs several {LoRA} modules, but more than three typically decrease the generation performance of pre-trained models. The mixture-of-experts model solves the performance issue, but {LoRA} modules are not combined using text prompts; hence, generating images by combining {LoRA} modules does not dynamically reflect the user’s desired requirements. This paper proposes a {LoRA} fusion method that applies an attention mechanism to effectively capture the user’s text-prompting intent. This method computes the cosine similarity between predefined keys and queries and uses the weighted sum of the corresponding values to generate task-specific {LoRA} modules without the need for retraining. This method ensures stability when merging multiple {LoRA} modules and performs comparably to fully retrained {LoRA} models. The technique offers a more efficient and scalable solution for domain adaptation in large language models, effectively maintaining stability and performance as it adapts to new tasks. In the experiments, the proposed method outperformed existing methods in text–image alignment and image similarity. Specifically, the proposed method achieved a text–image alignment score of 0.744, surpassing an {SVDiff} score of 0.724, and a normalized linear arithmetic composition score of 0.698. Moreover, the proposed method generates superior semantically accurate and visually coherent images.},

	abstract = {The field of artificial intelligence has introduced a groundbreaking process called text-to-image generation, which allows humans to visualize ideas in new ways. This study suggests that ar­ chitects and designers can utilize these tools in conceptual design to enhance their creativity. {AI} provides designers with fresh perspectives and opens up new possibilities for design concepts. These tools also allow for easier manipulation of data and the development of innovative solu­ tions to complex problems, expanding the designer’s range of creative abilities beyond traditional methods. We are examining the application of usage-based models to different activities, exploring the suitability of {DALL}-E 2, Midjourney, and {StableDi} platforms for typical examples in architectural design. By using {NLP} techniques to extract typical usage patterns from a data collection of 40 million Midjourney inquiries, we can analyze these patterns and how they are currently being used. We examined architectural glossaries to identify keywords related to ar­ chitecture. We only included keywords that appeared at least 10 \% of the time, and the names of 941 famous architects from Wikipedia were added to the keyword list. This allowed us to identify 2.6 million searches (6.8 \%) that potentially had an architectural intention, including 1 million (2.6 \%) that specifically mentioned "architect", "interior", or "exterior" design. Our filters ensured the accuracy of our findings. Conclusions, the use of technology can greatly enhance the engi­ neering design process. Architects and other creatives find it particularly exciting and useful due to its user-friendly interface and ability to generate a wide range of images.},
