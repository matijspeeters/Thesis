\section{Baudoux et al.} 

In the paper 'The benefits and challenges of AI image generators for architectural ideation: Study of an alternative human-machine co-creation exchange based on sketch recognition' \cite{baudoux_benefits_nodate}, the wizard of Oz-technique was used to emulate a design situation where the 'wizard' is regularly showing images to the architects. This paper shows that this kind of stimulation can help architects design. In this thesis, a similar approach is used to design together with architects. However, the technique is already developed. The researcher only serves as a middle person, communicating between the AI-model interface and the architect.
